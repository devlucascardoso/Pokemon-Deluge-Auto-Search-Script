# Pokémon Deluge Auto-Search Script

## Overview
Copy and paste this JavaScript script into your browser console to automatically search for Pokémon on Pokémon Deluge map pages[](https://www.delugerpg.com/map/*).

## Features
- Automatically moves the character until a target Pokémon is found.
- Locates Pokémon with the status "You don't have this Pokémon in your box."
- Locates unowned Legendary Pokémon.
- Locates Legendary Pokémon of special types "Shiny," "Retro," "Negative," or "Chrome."
- Automatically clicks the "Catch Pokémon" button when a target Pokémon is detected.

## How It Works
The script automates character movement (up and down) on Pokémon Deluge map pages. It continuously checks for Pokémon matching the specified conditions (new Pokémon, unowned legendaries, or special types like Shiny). Once a target Pokémon is found, the script automatically clicks the "Catch Pokémon" button to capture it.

## Usage
1. **Copy the script**: Use the code from `script.js`.
2. **Run in browser console**: Open the browser developer tools (F12), go to the Console tab, paste the script, and press Enter.
3. **Avoid Tampermonkey**: Running in Tampermonkey increases the risk of detection and bans.
4. **Control the script**: Use the "Pause Script" or "Resume Script" button to toggle execution.

## Installation
- No dependencies required.
- Ensure you are on a Pokémon Deluge map page[](https://www.delugerpg.com/map/*).
- Paste the script into the browser console to start.

## Future Ideas
- Add logic for auto-catching Pokémon in different scenarios.
- Implement auto-battle functionality for gym battles.
